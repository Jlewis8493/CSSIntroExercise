      <h1>Amish Farm</h1>
      <p>
        We were born at two different farms in Pennsylvania. We both worked on the farms
        with our siblings while we waiting for our new owners. Excited to start our jobs
        in Massachusetts, we got prepared for our new roles.

        <h1>Trouble Makers</h1>
        <p>
            Full time trouble makers. Always creating problems and getting into stuff that 
            we shouldn't be. Following the rules is boring in this role and we like to 
            live on the edge of going to the emergency vet. Who cares about the bill...
            our owners pay for that!

        <h1>Food Connoisseurs</h1>
        <p>
            All food is our food. Are you eating food? That's our food now. The objective is to
            test the food so that our owners know they're getting quality. Chicken, Hot Pockets,
            Italian Ice, Ice Cream, Pizza, it's all ours. It's a tough job but we get it done.
            Requires a lot of courage but we've got it.
